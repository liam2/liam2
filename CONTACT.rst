For any question, suggestion or comment you might have concerning LIAM2 usage,
please send a message to the `LIAM2-users mailing list <http://groups.google
.com/group/liam2-users>`_. Please note that, as a spam counter measure,
new member posts are moderated. We are doing all we can to let them through
as quickly as possible, but since it is a manual process it can take a few
hours, or exceptionally a few days. Please be patient in case your post is
delayed.

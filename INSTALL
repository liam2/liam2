Introduction
------------

To run LIAM2 from source, you first need to install all the
dependencies (see below), then (optionally) build the C extensions for
maximum performance, then simply run LIAM2 using:

python main.py import [your_import_file]
python main.py run [your_simulation_file]


List of dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LIAM2 uses a number of other open-source packages.

Required dependencies:
- Python 2.7.x (32b or 64b) - http://www.python.org/
- Numpy 1.7.0 or later - http://www.numpy.org/
- PyTables 3 or later - http://www.pytables.org
- Numexpr 2.0 or later - https://github.com/pydata/numexpr
- PyYAML 3.0.8 or later - http://pyyaml.org

Optional dependencies:
- to view hdf5 files: vitables 2.1 - http://vitables.org
  It requires PyQt4 - http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
- to generate plots and charts: matplotlib 1.2 or later - http://matplotlib.org/
  It requires python-dateutil - http://labix.org/python-dateutil
          and pyparsing - http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/
- to build the C extensions (see below):
  Cython 0.16 or later - http://www.cython.org/
- to build the documentation to html (other formats need additional packages):
  sphinx 1.0 or later - http://www.sphinx-doc.org/
- to create standalone executables:
  cx-freeze 4.3 or later - http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/
- to import data with interpolation/data with missing data points (eg several time series with different dates for the same individual):
  bcolz 0.7 or later - https://github.com/Blosc/bcolz

Installation
------------

There are several options to install all those packages.

In order of increasing difficulty:
* using Anaconda
* getting binary packages from Christoph Gohlke (Windows only)
* getting third-party packages directly from their authors


Using Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Install Anaconda 2.1 or later (Python 2.7). You can choose the 32-bit or
   64-bit version.

2) Install ViTables. In a command prompt, type:

   pip install https://vitables.googlecode.com/files/ViTables-2.1.tar.gz

Note that using other Python distributions should probably work, but we have
not tested that. As of this writing, Python(x,y) and WinPython are both missing
the "bcolz" package, so it would need to be installed from another source.


Getting binary packages from Christoph Gohlke (Windows only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Install Python 2.7.x (either 32 bits or 64 bits version):
   http://www.python.org/download/releases/

2) Get and use the installers for all LIAM2 dependencies from:
   http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

   Make sure you take the version of each package which match the version of
   Python you have chosen.


Getting third-party packages directly from their authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Install Python 2.7.x (either 32 bits or 64 bits version):
   http://www.python.org/download/releases/

2) Install all third-party packages manually. The problem with this approach
   is that there is not a single way which works for all our dependencies.
   Some packages provide binary installers for Windows (but often not for
   64-bit), some do not. Some require a C compiler and have some dependencies
   of their own before they can be installed. Some can be installed via
   "pip install [package_name]" but some do not. In that case one usually has
   to download the source and do "python setup.py install". In short, this
   approach takes a lot of time, so I would only recommend it as a last resort,
   especially if you want a 64-bit version of LIAM2 on Windows.


Building the C extensions
-------------------------

Additionally, if you want to get maximum performance, you will also need to
build the C extensions. This is optional but recommended.

For that you need to have cython (see above) and a C compiler installed, then
go to the root directory of LIAM2 and type:

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If all goes according to plan, you should then be up and running.


Building the documentation
--------------------------

0) make sure both PYTHONDIR and PYTHONDIR\Scripts is in your system PATH
   where PYTHONDIR is the directory where you installed Python

1) Install sphinx
2) Open a command prompt
3) Go to the documentation directory. For example:

  cd liam2\doc\usersguide\

3) Launch the build:

  make html

4) Open the result in your favourite web browser. It is located in:

  build/html/index.html


Installing on the GNU/linux debian distribution
-----------------------------------------------

Install the required dependencies:

  apt-get install python2.7 python-numpy python-tables python-numexpr python-yaml

You can also install the optional dependencies:
- to view hdf5 files via vitables
  apt-get install python-vitables
- to generate plots and charts: matplotlib
  apt-get install python-matplotlib python-dateutil python-pyparsing
- to build the C extensions (see above):
  apt-get install cython
- to build the documentation to html (other formats need additional packages):
  apt-get install python-sphinx
- to import data with interpolation/data with missing data points (eg several time series with different dates for the same individual):
  bcolz 0.7 or later - https://github.com/Blosc/bcolz

Install liam2 package as a simple user
  cd liam2
  pip install -e . --user
  or as root
  cd liam2
  pip install -e .

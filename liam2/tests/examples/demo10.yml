# This is a LIAM2 simulation file.

# This example creates another variant of our model, this time adding a new
# function. Let us suppose we want to avoid re-computig study_years_failed each
# period, so we move its computation to an init function.
# We re-use demo08.yml, change an existing function (ineducation) and add a new
# one (init_years_failed).

# Note that in this case, this is not necessarily a good idea since
# it cause a problem for new borns, which do not have any value assigned for
# study_years_failed. Fixing this problem is left as an exercice for the
# reader ;-).

# To run the simulation, press F6 if you are using the editor bundled with
# LIAM2, otherwise run the following command in a console:
# [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo10.yml
import: demo08.yml

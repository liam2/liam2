# This is a LIAM2 simulation file.

# This example introduces miscellaneous other basic features:
# (periodic) globals, macros, local variables in user-defined functions,
# the aggregate functions count and avg, the init phase and a few new arguments
# to built-in functions we have already seen.

# To run the simulation, press F6 if you are using the editor bundled with
# LIAM2, otherwise run the following command in a console:
# [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo03.yml

# Globals are variables (aka. parameters) that do not relate to any particular
# entity (they can be used in expressions in any entity). Globals can be of two
# kinds: tables (with several fields) and multi-dimensional arrays and can be
# loaded either from the HDF5 input file, like in this example, or directly
# from .csv files. Periodic globals have the particularity that they have a
# (potentially) different value for each period.
globals:
    periodic:
        # retirement age for wage earners in Belgium will increase from 65
        # years old to 66 in 2025 and 67 in 2030
        - RETIREMENTAGE: int

entities:
    person:
        fields:
            # period and id are implicit
            - age:    int
            - gender: bool

            # fields not present in input
            - agegroup: {type: int, initialdata: False}

        # macros can be used to replace any expression. They are usually used
        # to avoid repeating expressions and make code more readable.
        # After being declared in the macros section, using the name of the
        # macro in any process of the entity becomes entirely equivalent to
        # using the macro expression.
        macros:
            ISMALE: gender
            ISFEMALE: not gender

            ACTIVEAGE: (age >= 15) and (age < RETIREMENTAGE)

        # possible transitions and regressions
        processes:
            ageing:
                - age: age + 1

                # juniors and plus50 are *local* variables. This means they are
                # only usable within the ageing function. As we have seen in the
                # previous example, the agegroup process below could just as
                # well be written using a single process (without using local
                # variables).
                - juniors: 5 * trunc(age / 5)
                - plus50: 10 * trunc(age / 10)

                #   population (in this case, the active population)
                # * the suffix argument can be used to customize the name of the

                # * you can customize the filename more precisely (than with

                #   {entity} and {period} keywords. They are respectively

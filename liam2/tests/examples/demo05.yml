# This is a LIAM2 simulation file.

# This example builds upon the previous ones to introduce the concept of
# households, including young adults leaving their parents household.

# Technically, this demonstrates how to define a second entity,
# how to define links, how to access the fields of linked individuals, how to
# link individuals together, how change or break an existing link and
# how the new() function can be used with a different entity.

# To run the simulation, press F6 if you are using the editor bundled with
# LIAM2, otherwise run the following command in a console:
# [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo05.yml

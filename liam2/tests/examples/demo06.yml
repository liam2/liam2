# This is a LIAM2 simulation file.

# This example tries to get more realistic results out of the birth and
# death functions of previous models by using observed probabilities and
# alignment.

# Technically, this demonstrates the choice and logit_regr (with alignment)
# functions, and the default_entity option.

# To run the simulation, press F6 if you are using the editor bundled with
# LIAM2, otherwise run the following command in a console:
# [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo06.yml

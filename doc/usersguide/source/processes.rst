Processes
#########

The processes define how individuals of each entity evolve over time. LIAM2
supports several kinds of processes: :ref:`assignments <assignments>`, which
change the value of a variable (predictor) using an expression,
:ref:`actions <actions>` which don't (but have other effects) and
:ref:`control flow operators <while>` which specify which processes need to be
executed. Processes are usually grouped in :ref:`functions <functions>`.

.. index:: expressions

Expressions
===========

LIAM2 at its core compute expressions. Expressions are any combination of
variables, operators, constants, globals and functions which explain how to
compute a value.

Expression syntax looks like many other programming languages (>>> denotes an
interactive prompt): ::

  >>> 1 + 2
  3
  >>> 1.5 * 2.0 - 0.5 * 5.0
  0.5

Numeric constants with a fractional part (e.g. 3.0, 1.6) have type
float, others (e.g. 1, 2, 20) have type int.

Operations with mixed types (int and float) return floats. ::

  >>> 4 - 0.5 * 3
  2.5

Parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example: ::

  >>> (2.5 - 0.5) * 4
  8.0

LIAM2 supports many common operators:

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, \** (exponent), % (modulo)

.. note::

   An integer divided by an integer returns a float. For example "1 / 2"
   will evaluate to 0.5 instead of 0 as in many programming languages. If you
   are only interested in the integer part of that result (for example,
   if you know the result has no decimal part), you can use the *trunc*
   function: ::

     >>> trunc(3 / 2)
     1

- Comparison operators: <, <=, ==, !=, >=, >
- Boolean operators: and, or, not

.. note::

   Starting with version 0.6, you do not need to use parentheses when
   you mix *boolean operators* with other operators. ::

     age >= 10 and age < 20

   is now equivalent to: ::

     (age >= 10) and (age < 20)

.. _assignments:

Assignments
===========

Assignments compute values for existing individuals. They have the following
general format: ::

    - variable_name: expression

What this means is: compute expression and store the result in the variable
named *variable_name*. The variable that is assigned to (the *endogenous
variable*) will often be one of the variables defined in the
:ref:`fields_declaration` block of the entity but, as we will see later, it is
not always necessary.

*example* ::

    - age: age + 1

This process increases the variable *age* of each individual by one, each period.

.. _functions:

Functions
=========

.. index:: function declaration
.. _function_declaration:

Declaration
-----------

One usually group processes in *functions*. Whenever a function is executed,
the processes within the function are executed in the order they were declared.
By using functions, one can actually make *building blocks* or modules in the
model.

.. versionchanged:: 0.10
   Functions were previously called "procedures".

Each function definition starts at a new line with an extra indentation of four
spaces compared to the "processes" keyword of the current entity. Within a
function, each process should start on a new line, with an extra indentation of
four spaces compared to the function name and a -. So, the usual setup to
declare a function is: ::

    processes:
        function_name:
            - process1
            - process2

*example* ::

    entities:
        person:
            fields:
                - age: int

            processes:
                ageing:
                    - age: age + 1
                    - agegroup: trunc(age / 10) * 10

                display:
                    - show("agegroup", agegroup)

In this example, there are two functions, one with two processes, and one
with only one process. If the *ageing* function is executed, then both
processes will be executed in turn (*age*, then *agegroup*).

.. note:: Function names have to be **unique** for each entity.

Within a function, it is possible for several assignment processes to
modify the same variable. Like all processes within the function, they will
be executed in turn. Splitting an expression into smaller bits overwriting
the same variable over and over can make some long expressions much more
readable.

*example* ::

    processes:
        ageing:
            - age: age + 1
            - agegroup: trunc(age / 10)
            - agegroup: agegroup * 10

.. versionadded:: 0.10

Since version 0.10, functions can optionally also take arguments and return a
value. So the general setup to declare a function is: ::

    processes:
        function_name(argument1, argument2, ...):
            - process1
            - process2
            - return value

*example* ::

    plus(a, b):
        - show("adding", a, "and", b)
        - return a + b

.. note:: There are currently two ways to define a function without arguments
 (with or without the parentheses after the function name). The version without
 parentheses is going to be deprecated at some point in the future, so you
 might want to get used to typing the parentheses.


.. index:: function call
.. _function_call:

Call
----

To execute a function, it has to be either:

#. specified in the "processes" section of the simulation block of the model.

   *example* ::

     entities:
         person:
             fields:
                 - age: int
             processes:
                 ageing:
                     - age: age + 1
     simulation:
         processes:
             - person: [ageing]
         ...

#. called explicitly within an expression. In that case, the format is: ::

     function_name()

   If the function does not return any result (or if the result is not
   interesting), this comes down to: ::

     processes:
         myfunction:
             - anotherfunction()

   but it can really be used anywhere within an expression (whose result can
   be stored in a variable like any other expression): ::

     - variable_name: expr + function_name() * expr

   *example* ::

     entities:
         person:
             processes:
                 other_func:
                     - show("in other_func")

                 plus(a, b):
                     - return a + b

                 test_func:
                     - show("in test_func")
                     - other_func()
                     - show("back to test_func")
                     # storing the result in a temporary variable
                     - three: plus(1, 2)
                     - show("1 + 2 is", three)
                     # but the function call can happen anywhere within an
                     # expression
                     - show("(1 + 2) * 2 is", plus(1, 2) * 2)
     simulation:
         processes:
             - person: [test_func]


.. _local_variables:

Local (temporary) variables
---------------------------

All fields declared in the "fields" section of the entity are stored in the
output file. Often you need a variable only to store an intermediate result
during the computation of another variable.

In LIAM2, you can create a temporary variable at any point in the simulation by
simply having an assignment to an undeclared variable. Temporary variables
defined/computed within a function are local to that function: they are only
valid within that function and their value will be discarded at the end of the
function.

*example* ::

    person:
        fields:
            # period and id are implicit
            - age:      int
            - agegroup: int

    processes:
        ageing:
            - age: age + 1
            - agediv10: trunc(age / 10)
            - agegroup: agediv10 * 10

In this example, *agediv10* is a temporary (local) variable. In this
particular case, we could have bypassed the temporary variable, but when a
model contains very long expressions, it is often more readable to split it
using temporary variables. Also if some long expression occurs several times,
it is often more efficient to express it (and compute it) only once and store
its result in a temporary variable.

If you want to pass variables between functions you have to make them global by
defining them in the **fields** section.

**bad** *example* ::

    person:
        fields:
            - age: int

        processes:
            ageing:
                - age: age + 1
                - isold: age >= 150   # isold is a local variable
                - show("isold", isold)

            rejuvenation:
                - age: age – 1
                - backfromoldage: isold and age < 150  # <-- WRONG !
                - show("back from old age", backfromoldage)

In this example, *isold* and *backfromoldage* are local variables. They can only
be used in the function where they are defined. Because we are trying
to use the local variable *isold* in another function in this example, LIAM2
will refuse to run, complaining that *isold* is not defined.

.. _actions:

Actions
-------

In LIAM2, there are a few builtin functions which do not return any value (but
have other effects). We call those *actions*. Since they do not need a
variable to store their result, we simply: ::

    processes:
        function_name:
            - action_expression
            ...

*example* ::

    processes:
        death:
            - dead: age > 150
            - remove(dead)



.. index:: globals usage
.. _globals_usage:

globals
=======

Globals can be used in expressions in any entity. LIAM2 currently supports
two kinds of globals: tables and multi-dimensional arrays. They both declared
(see the :ref:`globals_declaration` section) before they can be used.

Globals tables come in two variety: those with a PERIOD column and those
without.

The fields in a globals **table with a PERIOD column** can be used
like normal (entity) fields except they need to be prefixed by the name of
their table: ::

    myvariable: mytable.MYINTFIELD * 10

the value for MYINTFIELD is in fact the value MYINTFIELD has for the period
currently being evaluated.

There is a special case for the **periodic** table: its fields do not need
to be prefixed by "periodic." (but they can be, if desired). ::

    - retirement_age: if(gender, 65, WEMRA)
    - workstate: if(age >= retirement_age, 9, workstate)


This changes the workstate of the individual to retired (9) if the age is
higher than the required retirement age in that year.

Another way to use globals from a table with a PERIOD column is to specify
explicitly for which period you want them to be evaluated. This is done by
using tablename.FIELDNAME[period_expr], where period_expr can be any
expression yielding a valid period value. Here are a few artificial
examples: ::

    - women_retirement_age_in_2010: WEMRA[2010]
    - women_retirement_age_in_previous_period: WEMRA[period - 1]
    # a possibly different value for each woman
    - women_retirement_age_when_60: WEMRA[year_of_birth + 60]

Globals tables **without a PERIOD column** can **only** be used with the second
syntax, and the row index (0 based) must be given explicitly: LIAM2 does
not automatically compute it (by subtracting the "base period" from the
index).

Globals **arrays** can simply be used like a normal field: ::

    myvariable: MYARRAY * 2


.. index:: builtin functions

Built-in Functions
==================

.. index:: conditional function, if

conditional function
--------------------

One of the most used function in LIAM2 is the conditional function. It
evaluates a condition and, depending on its value, returns the result of one
expression or another. Its general format is: ::

  if(condition_expression, expression_if_true, expression_if_false)

*example* ::

  agegroup: if(age < 50,
               5 * trunc(age / 5),
               10 * trunc(age / 10))

.. note::

   The *if* function always requires three arguments. If you want to leave a
   variable unchanged if a condition is not met, use the variable in the
   *expression_if_false*: ::

      # retire people (set workstate = 9) when aged 65 or more
      workstate: if(age >= 65, 9, workstate)

You can nest if-functions. The example below retires men (gender = True) over
64 and women over 61. ::

    workstate: if(gender,
                  if(age >= 65, 9, workstate),
                  if(age >= 62, 9, workstate))
    # could also be written like this:
    workstate: if(age >= if(gender, 65, 62), 9, workstate)


.. index:: mathematical functions, log, exp, abs, round, trunc, clip, min, max

mathematical functions
----------------------

- log(expr): natural logarithm (ln)
- exp(expr): exponential
- abs(expr): absolute value
- round(expr[, n]): returns the rounded value of expr to specified n (number of
  digits after the decimal point). If n is not specified, 0 is used.
- trunc(expr): returns the truncated value (by dropping the decimal part) of
  expr as an integer.
- clip(x, a, b): returns a if x < a, x if a < x < b, b if x > b.
- min(x, a), max(x, a): the minimum or maximum of x and a.
- erf(x): the error function

.. index:: aggregate functions

aggregate functions
-------------------

.. index:: count

- **count([condition])**: count individuals

It counts the individuals in the current entity. If a (boolean) condition is
given, it only counts the ones satisfying that condition. For example,
*count(male and age >= 18)* will produce the number of men in the sample who
are eighteen years old or older.

.. note::

   count() can be used without any argument: *count()* will return
   the total number of individuals in the sample for the current entity.

.. index:: sum

- **sum(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: sum of an expression

It computes the sum of any expression over all individuals of the current
entity. If a **filter** (boolean condition) is given, it only takes into account
the individuals satisfying the filter. For example *sum(earnings)* will
produce the sum of the earnings of all persons in the sample,
while *sum(earnings, age >= 30)* will produce the sum of the earnings
of all persons in the sample who are 30 or older. **skip_na** determines
whether missing values (nan) are discarded before the computation or not. It
defaults to *True*.

.. note::

   sum and count are exactly equivalent if their only argument is a boolean
   variable (eg. count(age >= 18) == sum(age >= 18)).

.. index:: avg

- **avg(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: average

.. index:: std

- **std(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: standard deviation

.. index:: min

- **min(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: minimum

.. index:: max

- **max(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: maximum

.. index:: median

- **median(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: median

.. index:: percentile

- **percentile(expr, percent[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: percentile

.. index:: gini

- **gini(expr[, filter=condition][, skip_na=True])**: gini

.. index:: all

- **all(condition1[, filter=condition2])**: is condition True for all?

Returns True if all individuals who satisfy the optional condition2
also satisfy condition1, False otherwise. Note that *all(condition1,
filter=condition2)* is equivalent to *all((condition1 and condition2) or
not condition2)*.

.. index:: any

- **any(condition1[, filter=condition2])**: is condition True for any?

Returns True if any individual who satisfy the optional condition2
also satisfy condition1, False otherwise. Note that *any(condition1,
filter=condition2)* is equivalent to *any(condition1 and condition2)*.

.. index:: link methods, link.count, link.sum, link.avg, link.min, link.max
.. _link_methods:

link methods
------------
(one2many links)

- link.count([filter]) - counts the number of related individuals
- link.sum(expr[, filter]) - compute the sum of an expression over the related
                             individuals
- link.avg(expr[, filter]) - compute the average of an expression over the
                             related individuals
- link.min(expr[, filter]) - compute the minimum of an expression over the
                             related individuals
- link.max(expr[, filter]) - compute the maximum of an expression over the
                             related individuals

*example* ::

    entities:
        household:
            fields:
                # period and id are implicit
                - nb_persons: {type: int, initialdata: False}

            links:
                persons: {type: one2many, target: person, field: household_id}

            processes:
                household_composition:
                    - nb_persons: persons.count()
                    - nb_children: persons.count(age < 18)
                    - total_income: persons.sum(income)
                    - avg_age: persons.avg(age)

.. index:: temporal functions, lag, value_for_period, duration, tavg, tsum

temporal functions
------------------

- lag(expr[, num_periods][, missing=value): value at previous period.

  **expr**: any expression.

  **num_periods**: optional argument specifying the number of periods to go
  back to. This can be either a constant or a scalar expression. Defaults to 1.

  **missing**: the value to return for individuals which were not present in
  the past period. By default, it returns the missing value corresponding to
  the type of the expression: -1 for an integer expression, nan for a float
  or False for a boolean.

  *example* ::

    lag(age)            # the age each person had last year, -1 if newborn
    lag(age, missing=0) # the age each person had last year, 0 if newborn
    avg(lag(age))       # average age that the current population had last year
    lag(avg(age))       # average age of the population of last year
    lag(age, 2)         # the age each person had two years ago (-1 for
                        # newborns)
    lag(lag(age))       # this is equivalent (but slightly less efficient)

- value_for_period(expr, period[, missing=value]): value at a specific period

  **expr**: any expression.

  **period**: the period used to evaluate the expression. This can be either a
  constant or a scalar expression.

  **missing**: the value to return for individuals which were not present in
  the period. By default, it returns the missing value corresponding to
  the type of the expression: -1 for an integer expression, nan for a float
  or False for a boolean.

  *example* ::

    value_for_period(inwork and not male, 2002)

- duration(expr): number of consecutive period the expression was True

  *examples* ::

    duration(inwork and (earnings > 2000))
    duration(educationlevel == 4)

- tavg(expr): average of an expression since the individual was created

  *example* ::

    tavg(income)

- tsum(expr): sum of an expression since the individual was created


.. index:: random
.. _random_functions:

random functions
----------------

LIAM2 includes support for many random number generator functions. Like for
all other functions in LIAM2, all arguments can be expressions (computed at
runtime) and arguments with default values can be omitted.
All those functions provide the same interface than (and actually internally
use) the corresponding functions in `numpy.random
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html>`_.

*examples* ::

    uniform()                   # uniform in [0, 1)
    normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0)  # standard normal (mean=0, stdev=1)
    normal()                    # equivalent
    normal(scale=std(errsal))   # stdev derived from the "errsal" variable

choice
~~~~~~

Monte Carlo or probabilistic simulation is a method for iteratively evaluating
a deterministic model using sets of random numbers as inputs. In
microsimulation, the technique is used to simulate changes of state dependent
variables. Take the simplest example:
suppose that we have an exogenous probability of an event happening, P(x=1),
or not P(x=0). Then draw a random number u from an uniform [0,1) distribution.
If, for individual i, ui < P(x=1), then xi=1.
If not, then xi=0.
The expected occurrences of x after, say, 100 runs is then P(x=1) * 100 and
the expected value is 1xP(1)+0xP(0)=P(1). This type of simulation hinges on the
confrontation between a random variable and an exogenous probability.

In LIAM2, such a probabilistic simulation is called a **choice** process.
Suppose i=1..n choice options, each with a probability prob_option_i. A
choice expression then has the following form: ::

    choice([option_1, option_2, ..., option_n],
           [prob_option_1, prob_option_2, ..., prob_option_n])

Note that both the list of options and their probabilities are between []’s.
The options can be of any numeric type.

A simple example of a process using a choice expression is the simulation of
the gender of newborns (51% males and 49% females), as such: ::

    gender: choice([True, False], [0.51, 0.49])

In the current version of LIAM2, it is not possible to combine a choice with
alignment.

Here is a more complex example of a process using choice. Suppose we want to
simulate the work status (blue collar worker or white collar worker) for all
working individuals. We want to assign 1 or 2 to their collar variable based
on their sex and level of education (education_level=2, 3, 4). We could write
our process as follow: ::

    collar_process:
        - no_collar: WORKING and collar == -1
        - collar: if(no_collar and (education_level == 2),
                     if(gender,
                        choice([1, 2], [0.836, 0.164]),
                        choice([1, 2], [0.687, 0.313]) ),
                     collar)
        - collar: if(no_collar and (education_level == 3),
                     if(gender,
                        choice([1, 2], [0.643, 1 - 0.643]),
                        choice([1, 2], [0.313, 1 - 0.313]) ),
                     collar)
        - collar: if(no_collar and (education_level == 4),
                     if(gender,
                        choice([1, 2], [0.082, 1 - 0.082]),
                        choice([1, 2], [0.039, 1 - 0.039]) ),
                     collar)

The function *collar_process* has collar as the key endogenous variable and
has four sub-processes.

The first sub-process defines a local variable no_collar, which will be used
to select those that the function should apply to. These are all the workers
that do not have a value for collar.

The next three sub-processes simulate the actual collar variable. If
one meets the above *no_collar* filter and has the lowest level of education
(2), then one has a probability of about 83.6% (men) and 68.7% (women) of
being a blue collar worker. If one has "education_level" equal to 3, the
probability of being a blue collar worker is lower (64.3% for men and
31.3% for women), etc.

.. index:: logit, alignment

Regressions
-----------

.. index:: logit_score

logit_score
~~~~~~~~~~~

The logit of a number p between 0 and 1 is given by the formula: ::

    logit(p) = log(p / (1 - p))

Its inverse, the logistic function has the interesting property that it can
convert any real number into a probability. ::

    logistic(a) = 1 / (1 + exp(-a))

The logit_score function is a logistic with a random part: ::

    logit_score(a) = logistic(a - logit(u))

where *u* is a random number from an uniform distribution [0, 1).

*logit_score* is very useful in behavioural equations. A behavioural equation
starts by creating a score that reflects the risk p*i of an event occurring.
A typical usage is as follow: ::

    - score_variable: if(condition_1,
                         logit_score(logit_expr_1),
                         if(condition_2,
                            logit_score(logit_expr_2),
                            -1))

However, the nested structure can make things less readable if you have many
different conditions. In that case, one would prefer the following longer
form: ::

    process_name:
        # initialise the score to -1
        - score_variable: -1

        # first condition
        - score_variable: if(condition_1,
                             logit_score(logit_expr_1),
                             score_variable)
        # second condition
        - score_variable: if(condition_2,
                             logit_score(logit_expr_2),
                             score_variable)

        # ... other conditions ...

In a first sub-process, a variable *score_variable* is set equal to -1,
because this makes it highly unlikely that the event will happen to those not
included in the conditions for which the logit is applied.

Next, subject to conditions *condition_1* and *condition_2*, this score (risk)
is simulated on the basis of estimated logits. Note that by specifying the
endogenous variable *score_variable* without any transformation in the "else"
conditions of the if functions makes sure that the score variable is not
manipulated by a sub-process it does not pertain to.

When the score is known, it can be either used as-is: ::

    - event_happened: uniform() < score_variable

or in combination with an alignment (see below).

.. index:: align, take, leave

align
~~~~~

Now that we have computed a score (risk) for an event happening, we might want
to use alignment so the number of events occuring per category matches a
proportion defined externaly.

There are different ways to choose which individuals are taken. The methodology
used for now by LIAM2 is called "alignment by sorting", that is, for each
category, the N individuals with the highest scores are selected.

The score computation is not done internally by the align() function, but is
rather computed by an expression given by the modeller. One will usually use
logit_score() to compute it, but it can be computed in any other way a
modeller choose.

.. note::

   It is usually a good idea to include a random component (like in
   logit_score) in the score expression because otherwise the individuals with
   the smaller scores will never be selected.

To know more about the alignment process reading "Evaluating Alignment Methods
in Dynamic Microsimulation Models", by Li and O'Donoghue is advised.

An alignment expression takes the following general form: ::

    align(score,
          proportions
          [, filter=conditions]
          [, take=conditions]
          [, leave=conditions]
          [, expressions=expressions]
          [, possible_values=pvalues]
          [, frac_need="uniform"|"round"|"cutoff"])

For example, it could look like: ::

    - unemp: align(unemp_score,
                   'al_p_unemployed_m.csv',
                   filter=not ISINWORK and (age > 15) and (age < 65),
                   take=ISUNEMPLOYED,
                   leave=ISSTUDENT or ISRETIRED)

Now let us examine each argument in turn:

 * **score**: it must be an expression (or a simple variable) returning
   a numerical value. It will be used to rank individuals. One will usually
   use logit_score() to compute the score, but it can be computed in any other
   way a modeller choose. Note that the score is not modified in any way
   within the align() function, so if one wants a random factor, it should be
   added manually (or through the use of a function like logit_score which
   includes one).

 * **proportions**: the target proportions for each category. This argument can
   take many forms. The most common one will probably be a
   string holding the name of a file containing the alignment data (like in
   the example above) but it can be any of the following:

    + a single scalar, for aligning with a constant proportion.
    + a list of scalars, for aligning with constant proportions per category.
    + an expression returning a single scalar.
    + an expression returning an n-dimensional array. expressions and
      possible values will be retrieved from that array, so you can simply
      use: ::

        align(score_expr, array_expr)

    + a list of expressions returning scalars [expr1, expr2].
    + a string treated as a filename. That file should be in the "array"
      format described in the :ref:`import_data` section. In that case, the
      proportions, expressions (column names) and possible values are read
      from that file. The "fname" argument which used to be the way to define
      this is still supported for backward compatibility.

      There is no technical restriction on names for files containing alignment
      data but, by convention, they usually use the following pattern: start
      with the prefix *al_* followed by the name of the endogenous variable
      and a suffix *_m* or *_f*, depending on gender.

 * **filter**: an expression specifying which individuals to take into account
   for the alignment. Note that if the align() function is used inside an
   *if()* expression, its filter is adjusted accordingly ("anded" with the
   filter of the if() expression). For example: ::

     - aligned: if(condition,
                   align(score_expr1, 'filename1.csv'),
                   align(score_expr2, 'filename2.csv'))

   is equivalent to: ::

     - aligned1: align(score_expr1, 'filename1.csv', filter=condition)
     - aligned2: align(score_expr2, 'filename2.csv', filter=not condition)
     - aligned: if(condition, aligned1, aligned2)

 * **take**: an expression specifying individuals which should always be
   selected, regardless of their score. This argument should be used with care
   as those individuals will be selected unconditionally, even if that means
   overflowing the number of individuals desired to satisfy the alignment.

   Suppose that the alignment specifies that 10 individuals should experience
   a certain event, and that there are 3 individuals who meet the conditions
   specified in the *take*. Then these 3 individuals will be selected a priori
   (irrespective of their score) and the alignment process will select the
   remaining 7 candidates from the rest of the sample.

   A "softer" alternative can be easily achieved by setting a very high score
   for individuals to be taken first.

 * **leave**: an expression specifying individuals which should never be
   selected, regardless of their score. This argument should be used with care
   as those individuals will *never* be selected, even if that cause the target
   number of individuals for some categories to not be reached.

   A "softer" alternative can be easily achieved by setting a very low score
   for individuals to be taken last.

   .. note::

      Note that even if the score for an individual is -1 (or any other
      negative number), it *can* still be selected by the alignment expression.
      This happens when there are not enough candidates (selected by the filter)
      to meet the alignment needs.

 * **expressions**: specify the expressions used to partition the individuals
   into the different alignment categories. If proportions is a file name, the
   column names declared in the file are used by default, but they can be
   overridden using this argument. For example: ::

     align(0.0, 'al_p_dead.csv', expressions=[gender, age + 1])

 * **possible_values**: specify the different values for each of the
   expressions in the expressions argument that should be evaluated. The
   combination of the different lists of possible values will form all the
   alignment categories. For example: ::

     align(0.0,
           proportions=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
           expressions=[gender, age < 50],
           possible_values=[[False, True], [False, True]])

 * **frac_need**: control how "fractional needs" are handled. This argument
   can take any of three values: "uniform" (default), "cutoff" or "round".

    + "uniform" draws a random number (u) from an uniform distribution and
      adds one individual if u < fractional_need. "uniform" is the default
      behavior.
    + "round" simply rounds needs to the nearest integer. In other words, one
      individual is added for a category if the fractional need for that
      category is >= 0.5.
    + "cutoff" tries to match the total need as closely as possible (at the
      expense of a slight loss of precision for individual categories) by
      searching for the "cutoff point" that yields: ::

        count(frac_need >= cutoff) == sum(frac_need)

In practice alignment data is often separate for men and women. In that case,
one will usually use the following form: ::

    - variable: if(condition,
                   if(gender,
                      align(score_expr, 'filename_m.csv'),
                      align(score_expr, 'filename_f.csv')),
                   False)

Since LIAM2 supports alignment with any number of dimensions, one could also
merge both data files in a single file with one more dimension and use a
single align() expression: ::

    - variable: if(condition,
                   align(score_expr, 'filename_m_and_f.csv'),
                   False)
    # or even
    - variable: align(score_expr, 'filename_m_and_f.csv', filter=condition)

The example below describes the process of getting (or keeping) a job: ::

    inwork:
        - work_score: -1
        # men
        - work_score: if(ISMALE and ACTIVEAGE and ISINWORK,
                         logit_score(-0.196599 * age + 0.0086552 * age **2 - 0.000988 * age **3
                                     + 0.1892796 * ISMARRIED + 3.554612),
                         work_score)
        - work_score: if(ISMALE and ACTIVEAGE and (ISUNEMPLOYED or ISOTHERINACTIVE),
                         logit_score(0.9780908 * age - 0.0261765 * age **2 + 0.000199 * age **3
                                     - 12.39108),
                         work_score)
        # women
        - work_score: if(ISFEMALE and ACTIVEAGE and ISINWORK,
                         logit_score(-0.2740483 * age + 0.0109883 * age **2 - 0.0001159 * age **3
                                     - 0.0906834 * ISMARRIED + 3.648706),
                         work_score)
        - work_score: if(ISFEMALE and ACTIVEAGE and (ISUNEMPLOYED or ISOTHERINACTIVE),
                         logit_score(0.8217638 * age - 0.0219761 * age **2 + 0.000166 * age **3
                                     - 0.5590975 * ISMARRIED - 10.48043),
                         work_score)

        - work: if(ACTIVEAGE,
                   if(ISMALE,
                      align(work_score, 'al_p_inwork_m.csv',
                            leave=ISSTUDENT or ISRETIRED),
                      align(work_score, 'al_p_inwork_f.csv',
                            leave=ISSTUDENT or ISRETIRED)),
                   False)

The first sub process illustrates a "*soft leave*" by setting the score
variable *work_score* to -1. This makes sure that the a priori selection
probability is very low (but not zero, as in the case of *leave* conditions)
for those who satisfy the filter of the alignment but for which a score is not
explicitly specified the subsequent processes.

Next come four *if* conditions, separating the various behavioural equations
to the sub-sample they pertain to. The first two conditions pertain to men
and respectively describe the probability of keeping a job and getting a job.
The next two conditions describe the same transitions but for women.

The last sub-process describes the alignment process itself. Alignment is
applied to individuals between the age of 15 and 65. The input-files of the
alignment process are 'al_p_inwork_m.csv' and 'al_p_inwork_f.csv'. The
alignment process uses as input the scores simulated previously, and the
information in the alignment files and sets the boolean variable *work*.
No "take" or "leave" conditions are used in this case.

.. index:: align_abs

align_abs
~~~~~~~~~

align_abs is equivalent to align(), except that it aligns to absolute numbers
instead of proportions. It also supports a few additional arguments to work
on a **linked entity**.

The general form of align_abs is : ::

    align_abs(score,
              need,
              [filter=conditions,]
              [take=conditions,]
              [leave=conditions,]
              [expressions=expressions,]
              [possible_values=pvalues,]
              [frac_need="uniform"|"round"|"cutoff",]
              [link=link_name,]
              [secondary_axis=column_name,]
              [errors="default"|"carry",]
              [method="bysorting"|"sidewalk"])

In addition to all the arguments supported by *align()*, *align_abs()* also
supports an optional "link" argument, which makes it work on a linked entity.

Here is a description of the arguments specific to align_abs:

  * **link**: must be the name of a one2many link. When the link argument is
    used, the groups (given by the alignment file or in the *expressions*
    argument) are evaluated on the linked entity and the needs are expressed
    in terms of that linked entity. When the link argument is in effect,
    align_abs uses the "Chenard" algorithm.

    This can be used, for example, to take as many *households* as necessary
    trying to get as close as possible to a particular distribution of
    *persons*.

  * **secondary_axis**: name of an axis which will influence rel_need when the
    subtotal for that axis is exceeded. See total_by_sex in Chenard.
    *secondary_axis* can only be used in combination with the link argument
    and it *must* be one of the alignment columns.

  * **errors**: if set to 'carry', the error for a period (difference between
    the number of individuals aligned and the target for each category) is
    stored and added to the target for the next period.
    In the current version of LIAM2, *errors* can only be used in combination
    with the *link* argument.

  * **method**: is the name of the method to do the alignment.
    The default "bysorting" method sorts the individuals by score and takes as
    many individuals as necessary by descending order of score. The "sidewalk"
    method traverse individuals in some random order, does a cumulative sum
    of the probability and each time there is a change of the integer part of
    the accumulated probability, the corresponding individual is selected.

*example* ::

    test_align_link:
        # this is a function defined at the level of households
        - num_persons: persons.count()
        - total_population: sum(num_persons)

        # MIG_PERCENT is a simple float periodic global
        - num_migrants: total_population * MIG_PERCENT

        # MIG is a 3d array: age - gender - period but we want only the
        # 2d array for this period.
        # currently, we need to manually compute the index (0-based)
        # for the current period in the array. We know the first
        # period in our array is 2000, so the index for the current
        # period is: "period - 2000"
        # period is the last dimension of the array and we do not
        # want to modify other dimensions, so we use ":" for those
        # dimensions.
        - mig_period: MIG[:,:,period - 2000]

        # Distribute total desired migrants, by age and gender
        - need: num_migrants * mig_period

        # households have a 50% chance to be candidate for immigration
        - is_candidate: uniform() < 0.5

        # apply alignment, using the number of persons in each household
        # as a score, so that households with more persons are tried first
        # as this gives better results.
        - aligned: align_abs(num_persons, need,
                             filter=is_candidate,
                             link=persons, secondary_axis=gender,
                             errors='carry')

.. index:: logit_regr

logit_regr
~~~~~~~~~~

logit_regr is a shortcut form to call logit_score and "evaluate whether the
event happened" in a single function. Thus, the function returns a boolean:
True for individuals which are selected, False for all others.
Its general form is: ::

  - aligned: logit_regr(expression,
                        [filter=conditions,]
                        [align=proportions])

The *align* argument supports all the same formats than the *proportions*
argument of align(): filename, percentage, list of values, ...

Evaluation whether the event happens is done differently whether the align
argument is used or not. If alignment is used, logit_regr is equivalent to: ::

  - aligned: align(logit_score(expression), proportions, filter=conditions)

Without align argument, the condition for the event occurring is p*i > 0.5,
which means that in this form, logit_regr is equivalent to: ::

  - aligned: if(conditions, logit_score(expression) > 0.5, False)

*example* ::

  - to_give_birth: logit_regr(0.0,
                              filter=FEMALE and (age >= 15) and (age <= 50),
                              align='al_p_birth.csv')

.. index:: matching functions

Matching functions
------------------

The goal of matching functions is to match individuals from a set with
individuals from another set, for example to select spouses for marriage. There
are many different algorithms to do so. LIAM2 currently implements two:
**matching** takes the highest scoring individual in set 2 for each
individual in set1, while **rank_matching** sorts both sets by their own
ordering expression and match individuals with the same rank.

.. _matching:
.. index:: matching

matching
~~~~~~~~

For each individual in set 1 following the order given by the *orderby*
argument, the function computes the score of all (unmatched) individuals in
set 2 and takes the highest scoring one. The function returns the id of the
matched individual for each individual which was actually matched, -1 for
others. If the two sets are of different sizes, the surplus of the largest set
is ignored.

*generic setup* ::

    matching(set1filter=boolean_expr,
             set2filter=boolean_expr,
             score=coef1 * field1 + coef2 * other.field2 + ...,
             orderby=expr,                # expression or 'EDtM'
             [pool_size=int,]             # None by default
             [algo="onebyone"|"byvalue"]) # "onebyone" by default

Arguments:

 * **set1filter** and **set2filter** specify the boolean filters which provide
   the two sets to match.

 * **score** is an expression to assign a value to each individual of set 2
   (given a particular individual in set 1). In the score expression the fields
   of the set 1 individual can be used normally while the fields of its possible
   partners (from set 2) can be used by prefixing them by "**other.**".

 * **orderby** defines the order in which the individuals of the first set
   are matched. It can be either an expression or the 'EDtM' string. If it is an
   expression, individuals in set 1 will by sorted by its decreasing values. If
   set to 'EDtM' (Euclidean Distance to the Mean), individuals will be sorted by
   decreasing distance to an hypothetical "mean individual" measured on all the
   variables (of set 1) used in the score expression [#footnote1]_. In short,
   "unusual individuals" will be matched first.

 * The optional **pool_size** argument specifies the size of the subset of set 2
   to use as candidates. If used, it should be a positive integer. In that case,
   the best match for each individual of set 1 will be searched for in a random
   subset of size *pool_size*, instead of in all unmatched individuals in set 2.
   This may be closer to actual marriage where people do not meet every single
   potential partner. When the remaining number of candidates in set 2 is lower
   than pool_size, the match is looked for among all remaining candidates.

   .. versionadded:: 0.9

 * The optional **algo** argument specifies the algorithm to use. It can be set
   to either "onebyone" or "byvalue".

   + "onebyone" is the current default and should give the same result than with
     LIAM2 versions < 0.9.

   + "byvalue" groups individuals by their value for all the variables involved
     in both the score and orderby expressions, and match groups together.
     Depending on whether all individuals in each set have many different
     combinations of values or not, this is usually much faster than matching
     each individual in turn. It is thus **highly encouraged** to use this
     option if possible. It will become the default value in a future version.
     This algorithm also scales better (O(N1g*N2g) instead of O(N1*N2) where
     N1g and N2g are the number of combination of values in each set and N1 and
     N2 are the number of individuals in each set).

     .. note:: the "byvalue" algorithm is only available if the C extensions are
               installed.

   .. warning:: The results of the two algorithms are **NOT** exactly the same,
                hence the switch cannot be done lightly from one to another if
                comparing simulation results with those of an earlier version
                of LIAM2 (< 0.9) is of importance.

        - to_couple: not in_couple and age >= 18 and age <= 90
        - avg_age_males_to_couple: avg(age, filter=to_couple and MALE)
        - difficult_match: if(to_couple and FEMALE,
                              abs(age - avg_age_males_to_couple),
                              nan)
        - partner_id: if(to_couple,
                         matching(set1filter=FEMALE, set2filter=MALE,

                                        + 0.0467 * (other.age - age)
                                        - 0.0189 * (other.age - age) ** 2
                                        + 0.0003 * (other.age - age) ** 3
                                        - 0.9087 * (other.work and not work)
                                        - 1.3286 * (not other.work and work)
                                        - 0.6549 * (other.work and work)),
                         partner_id)

The code above shows an application. First, we decided that all persons
between 18 and 90 years old who are not part of a couple are candidate for
marriage. Next, for each candidate women, the variable *difficult_match* is
the difference between her age and the average age of candidate men.

In a third step, for each candidate woman in turn (following the order set by
*difficult_match*), all candidate men which are still available are assigned
a score and the man with the highest score is matched with that woman.
This score depends on his age, his difference in age with the woman and the
work status of the potential partners.

The function returns the id of the matched individual for each individual which

Lifecycle functions
-------------------

.. index:: new

new
~~~

**new** creates new individuals. It can create individuals of the same entity
(eg. a women gives birth) or another entity (eg. a *person*'s marriage creates
a new *houshold*). The function returns the id of the newly created
individuals.

*generic format* ::

    new('entity_name'[, filter=expr][, number=value]
        *set initial values of a selection of variables*)

The first argument specifies the entity in which the individuals will be
created (eg person, household, ...).

Then, one should use one of either the *filter* or the *number* argument.

 * **filter** specifies which individuals of the current entity will serve as
   the origin for the new individuals (for persons, that would translate to
   who is giving birth, but the function can of course be used for any kind of
   entity).

 * **number** specifies how many individuals need to be created. In this
   version, those new individuals do not have an "origin", so they can copy
   value from it.

Any subsequent argument specifies values for fields of the new individuals. Any
field which is not specified there will receive the missing value corresponding
to the type of the field ('nan' for floats, -1 for integers and False for
booleans). Those extra arguments can be given constants, but also any
expression (possibly using links, random functions, ...). Those expressions are
evaluated in the context of the origin individuals. For example, you could
write "mother_age = age", which would set the field "mother_age" on the new
children to the age of their mother.

*example 1* ::

    birth:
        - to_give_birth: logit_regr(0.0,
                                    filter=not gender and
                                           (age >= 15) and (age <= 50),
                                    align='al_p_birth.csv')
        - new('person', filter=to_give_birth,
              mother_id = id,
              father_id = partner.id,
              household_id = household_id,
              partner_id = -1,
              age = 0,
              civilstate = SINGLE,
              gender=choice([True, False], [0.51, 0.49]) )

The first sub-process (*to_give_birth*) is a logit regression over women (not
gender) between 15 and 50 which returns a boolean value whether that person
should give birth or not. The logit itself does not have a deterministic part
(0.0), which means that all women that meet the above condition are equally
likely to give birth (they are selected randomly). This process is also
aligned on the data in 'al_p_birth.csv'.

In the above case, a new person is created for each time a woman is selected to
give birth. Secondly, a number of links are established: the value for the
*mother_id* field of the child is set to the id-number of his/her mother, the
child's father is set to the partner of the mother, the child receives the
household number of his/her mother, ... Finally some variables of the child are
set to specific initial values: the most important of these is its gender,
which is the result of a simple choice process.

**new** can create individuals of different entities; the below function
*get_a_life* makes sure that all those who are single when they are 24 year
old, leave their parents’ household for their own household. The region of
this new household is created randomly through a choice-process.

*example 2* ::

    get_a_life:
        - household_id: if(ISSINGLE and age == 24,
                           new('household',
                               region_id=choice([0, 1, 2, 3],
                                                [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])),
                           household_id)

.. index:: clone

clone
~~~~~

**clone** is very similar to **new** but is intended for cases where
most or all variables describing the new individual should be copied from
his/its parent/origin instead of being set to "missing". With clone, you cannot
specify what kind of entity you want to create, as it is always the same as the
origin item. However, similarly to **new**, **clone** also allows fields to be
specified manually by any expression evaluated on the parent/origin.

Put differently, a **new** with no fields mentioned will result in a new item
of which the initial values of the fields are all set to missing and have to be
filled through simulation; on the contrary, a **clone** with no fields mentioned
will result in a new item that is an exact copy of the origin except for its
id number which is always set automatically.

*example* ::

    make_twins:
        - clone(filter=new_born and is_twin,
                gender=choice([True, False], [0.51, 0.49]))

.. index:: remove

remove
~~~~~~

**remove** removes items from an entity dataset. With this command you can
remove obsolete items (eg. dead persons, empty households) thereby ensuring they
are not simulated anymore. This will also save some memory and, in some cases,
improve simulation speed.


The function below simulates whether an individual survives or not, and what
happens in the latter case. ::

    dead_function:
        # decide who dies
        - dead: if(gender,
                   logit_regr(0.0, align='al_p_dead_m.csv'),
                   logit_regr(0.0, align='al_p_dead_f.csv'))
        # change the civilstate of the suriving partner
        - civilstate: if(partner.dead, 5, civilstate)
        # break the link to the dead partner
        - partner_id: if(partner.dead, -1, partner_id)
        # remove the dead
        - remove(dead)

The first sub-process *dead* simulates whether an individual is ‘scheduled for
death’, using again only a logistic stochastic variable and the
age-gender-specific alignment process. Next some links are updated for the
surviving partner.
The sub-process *civilstate* puts the variable of that name equal to 5 (which
means that one is a widow(er) for those individuals whose partner has been
scheduled for death. Also, in that case, the partner identification code is
erased. All other processes describing the heritage process should be included
here. Finally, the *remove* command is called to removes the *dead* from the
simulation dataset.

    - while scalar_condition:
        - the_code_to_repeat
        - ...

.. warning:: the condition must be a scalar expression, that is it must have
             a single value for all individuals. In other words, the number
             of iterations is always the same for all individuals. See examples
             below.

*example 1* ::

    count_to_5:
        - i: 1
        - while i <= 5:
            - show(i)
            - i: i + 1

Now let us suppose one wants to repeat a computation until some condition is
met per individual. One could intuitively write it like below.

**bad** *example* ::

    wrong_repeat_while_below_1:
        - score: age / max(age)
        - while score < 1:   # <-- this line is WRONG !
            - score: score + 0.1
        - show(score)

However, that would result in this error: ::

    ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is
    ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

The solution is to follow the advice in the error message and use any() in
this case.

*example 2* ::

    repeat_while_below_1:
        - score: age / max(age)
        - while any(score < 1):
            - score: score + 0.1
        - show(score)

This will repeat the code until all individuals have reached the target **but**
individuals who reached it early will continue to be updated, and it might
not be what is needed. If that is the case, one has to **explicitly** only
update the individuals which are not "done" yet.

*example 3* ::

    repeat_while_below_1:
        - score: age / max(age)
        - while any(score < 1):
            - score: if(score < 1, score + 0.1, score)
        - show(score)

Output
======

LIAM2 produces simulation output in three ways. First of all, by default, the
simulated datasets are stored in hdf5 format. These can be accessed at the end
of the run. You can use several tools to inspect the data.

You can display information during the simulation (in the console log) using
the *show* function. You can write that same information to csv files using
the *csv* function. You can produce tabular data by using the *dump* or
*groupby* functions.

In the interactive console, you can use any of those output functions to
inspect the data interactively.


.. index:: show

show
----

*show* evaluates expressions and prints the result to the console log. Note
that, in the *interactive console*, show is implicit on all commands, so you
do not need to use it. *show* has the following signature: ::

    show(expr1[, expr2, expr3, ...])

*example 1* ::

    show(count(age >= 18))
    show(count(not dead), avg(age, filter=not dead))

The first process will print out the number of persons of age 18 and older in
the dataset. The second one displays the number of living people and their
average age.

*example 2* ::

    show("Count:", count(),
         "Average age:", avg(age),
         "Age std dev:", std(age))

gives ::

    Count: 19944 Average age: 42.7496991576 Age std dev: 21.9815913417

Note that you can use the special character "\\n" to display the rest of the
result on the next line.

*example 3* ::

    show("Count:", count(),
         "\nAverage age:", avg(age),
         "\nAge std dev:", std(age))

gives ::

    Count: 19944

    Age std dev: 21.9815913417

.. index:: qshow

qshow
-----

*qshow* evaluates expressions and prints their results to the console log
alongside the "textual form" of the expressions. If several expressions are
given, they are each printed on a separate line. *qshow* usage is exactly the
same than *show*.

*example* ::

    qshow(count(), avg(age), std(age))

will give: ::

    count(): 19944
    avg(age): 42.7496991576
    std(a=age): 21.9815913417


.. index:: csv

csv
---

The **csv** function writes values to csv files. ::

    csv(expr1[, expr2, expr3, ...,
        [suffix='file_suffix'][, fname='filename'][, mode='w'])

'suffix', 'fname' and 'mode' are optional arguments. By default (if neither
'fname' nor 'suffix' is used), the name of the csv file is generated using the
following pattern: "{entity}_{period}.csv".

*example* ::

    csv(avg(income))

will create one file for each simulated period. Assuming, start_period is
2002 and periods is 2, it will create two files: "person_2002.csv" and
"person_2003.csv" with the average income of the population for period
2002 and 2003 respectively.

Arguments:

  - 'suffix' allows to customize the name of the files easily.
    When it is used, the files are named using the following pattern:
    "{entity}_{period}_{suffix}.csv".

    *example* ::

        csv(avg(income), suffix='income')

    would create "person_2002_income.csv" and "person_2003_income.csv".

  - 'fname' allows defining the exact file name or pattern to use.
    You can optionally use the '{entity}' and '{period}' key words to customize
    the name.

    *example* ::

        csv(avg(income), fname='income{period}.csv')

    would create "income2002.csv" and "income2003.csv".

  - 'mode' allows appending (mode='a') to a csv file instead of overwriting it
    (mode='w' by default). This allows you, for example, to store the value of
    some expression for all periods in the same file (instead of one file per
    period by default).

    *example* ::

        csv(period, avg(income), fname='avg_income.csv', mode='a')

    .. note::

       Unless you erase/overwrite the file one way or another between
       two runs of a simulation, you will append the data of the current
       simulation to that of the previous one. One way to do overwrite the file
       automatically at the start of a simulation is to have a function in the
       init section without mode='a'.

    If you want that file to start empty, you can do so this way: ::

        csv(fname='avg_income.csv')

    If you want some headers in your file, you could write them at that
    point: ::

        csv('period', 'average income', fname='avg_income.csv')

When you use the csv() function in combination with (at least one) table
expressions (see dump and groupby functions below), the results are appended
below each other. ::

    csv(table_expr1, 'and here goes another table', table_expr2,
        fname='tables.csv')

Will produce a file with a layout like this: ::

  | table 1 value at row 1, col 1 | col 2 |   ... | col N |
  |                           ... |   ... |   ... |   ... |
  |                  row N, col 1 | col 2 |   ... | col N |
  | and here goes another table   |       |       |       |
  | table 2 value at row 1, col 1 |   ... | col N |       |
  |                           ... |   ... |   ... |       |
  |                  row N, col 1 |   ... | col N |       |

You can also output several rows with a single command by enclosing values
between brackets: ::

    csv([row1value1, ..., row1valueN],
        ...
        [rowNvalue1, ..., rowNvalueN],
        fname='several_rows.csv')

*example* ::

    csv(['this is', 'a header'],
        ['with', 'several lines'],
        fname='person_age_aggregates.csv')

Will produce a file with a layout like this: ::

| this is | a header      |
| with    | several lines |

.. index:: dump

dump
----

**dump** produces a table with the expressions given as argument evaluated over
many (possibly all) individuals of the dataset.

*general format* ::

    dump([expr1, expr2, ...,
         filter=filterexpression, missing=value, header=True, limit=None])

If no expression is given, *all* fields of the current entity will be dumped
(including temporary variables available at that point), otherwise, each
expression will be evaluated on the objects which satisfy the
filter and produce a table.

The 'filter' argument allows to evaluate the expressions only on the
individuals which satisfy the filter. Defaults to None (evaluate on all
individuals).

The 'missing' argument can be used to transform 'nan' values to another value.
Defaults to None (no transformation).

The 'header' argument determine whether column names should be in the dump or
not. Defaults to True.

The 'limit' argument specifies the maximum number of rows of the output.
Defaults to None (no limit).

*example* ::

    show(dump(age, partner.age, gender, filter=id < 10))

gives ::

    id | age | partner.age | gender
     0 |  27 |          -1 |  False
     1 |  86 |          71 |  False
     2 |  16 |          -1 |   True
     3 |  19 |          -1 |  False
     4 |  27 |          21 |  False
     5 |  89 |          92 |   True
     6 |  59 |          61 |   True
     7 |  65 |          29 |  False
     8 |  38 |          35 |   True
     9 |  48 |          52 |   True

.. index:: groupby

groupby
-------

**groupby** (aka *pivot table*): group all individuals by their value for the
given expressions, and optionally compute an expression for each group (using
the *expr* argument). If no expression is given, it will compute the number of
individuals in that group. A *filter* can be specified to limit the
individuals taken into account.

*general format* ::

    groupby(expr1[, expr2, expr3, ...]
            [, expr=expression]
            [, filter=filterexpression]
            [, percent=True],
            [, pvalues=possible_values])

*example* ::

    show(groupby(trunc(age / 10), gender))

gives ::

    trunc((age / 10)) | gender |      |
                      |  False | True | total
                    0 |    818 |  803 |  1621
                    1 |    800 |  800 |  1600
                    2 |   1199 | 1197 |  2396
                    3 |   1598 | 1598 |  3196
                    4 |   1697 | 1696 |  3393
                    5 |   1496 | 1491 |  2987
                    6 |   1191 | 1182 |  2373
                    7 |    684 |  671 |  1355
                    8 |    369 |  357 |   726
                    9 |    150 |  147 |   297
                total |  10002 | 9942 | 19944

*example* ::

    show(groupby(inwork, gender))

gives ::

    inwork | gender |      |
           |  False | True | total
     False |   6170 | 5587 | 11757
      True |   3832 | 4355 |  8187
     total |  10002 | 9942 | 19944

*example* ::

    show(groupby(inwork, gender, percent=True))

gives ::

    inwork | gender |      |
           |  False | True | total
     False | 30.94 | 28.01 |  58.95
      True | 19.21 | 21.84 |  41.05
     total | 50.15 | 49.85 | 100.00

*example* ::

    groupby(workstate, gender, expr=avg(age))

gives the average age by workstate and gender ::

    workstate | gender |       |
              |  False |  True | total
            1 |  41.29 | 40.53 | 40.88
            2 |  40.28 | 44.51 | 41.88
            3 |   8.32 |  7.70 |  8.02
            4 |  72.48 | 72.27 | 72.38
            5 |  42.35 | 46.56 | 43.48
        total |  42.67 | 42.38 | 42.53

As of version 0.6, groupby can also be used in larger expressions. This can be
used for example to compute alignment targets on the fly: ::

    # see note below about expr=count(condition) vs filter=condition
    - men_by_age: groupby(age, expr=count(gender))
    - men_prop_by_age: men_by_age / groupby(age)
    - aligned: align(proportions=men_prop_by_age)

Note that there is a subtle difference between using "filter=condition" and
"expr=count(condition))". The former will not take the filtered individuals
into account at all, while the later will take them into account but not count
them. This can make a difference on the output if there are some empty
categories, and this can be important when using the result of a groupby
inside a larger expression (as above) because it can only work with arrays of
the same size. Compare : ::

  groupby(civilstate, filter=age > 80)

  civilstate |     |    |
           1 |   3 |  4 | total
         542 | 150 | 85 |   777

with ::

  groupby(civilstate, expr=count(age > 80))

  civilstate |   |     |    |
           1 | 2 |   3 |  4 | total
         542 | 0 | 150 | 85 |   777

The *expr* argument will usually be used with an aggregate function, but it
also supports normal expressions, in which case the values for each individual
will be displayed in a list. This feature should only be used with care and
usually in combination with a strong *filter* to avoid producing extremely
large tables which would take forever to display. ::

  groupby(agegroup_civilstate, gender, expr=id, filter=id < 20)

  agegroup_civilstate |        gender |             |
                      |         False |        True |                total
                    0 |     [0 1 4 6] |   [2 3 5 7] |    [0 1 4 6 2 3 5 7]
                    5 |     [8 10 12] |   [9 11 13] |    [8 10 12 9 11 13]
                   10 |    [14 16 18] |  [15 17 19] |  [14 16 18 15 17 19]
                total | [0 1 4 6 8 10 |  [2 3 5 7 9 |  [0 1 4 6 8 10 12 14

or ::

  groupby(civilstate, gender, expr=age, filter=id > 100 and id < 110)

  civilstate |        gender |                  |

.. index:: charts
.. _charts:

charts
------

.. versionadded:: 0.8

LIAM2 has some charting capabilities, courtesy of `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org>`_. They are available both during a simulation
and in the interactive console. Each of the following functions is
designed around the function of the same name in matplotlib. Even though we
have tried to stay as close as possible to their API, their implementation in
LIAM2 has a few differences, in particular we added a few arguments which
are available in most functions.

* *fname*: name of the file to save the chart to. The file format is
  automatically deduced from the file extension. You can optionally use the
  '{entity}' and '{period}' key words to customize the name. You can save the
  same chart to several formats at once by using '&' in the extension. For
  example: ``plot(expr, fname='plot03.png&pdf')`` will write the chart to both
  ``plot03.png`` and ``plot03.pdf``. If the *fname* argument is not used,
  a window will open to view and interact with the figure using a navigation
  toolbar. See `matplotlib navigation toolbar documentation
  <http://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html>`_ for more details.

  .. note::
     Keyboard shortcuts mentioned on that page currently do not work.

* *suffix*: a more concise alternative to set the name of the file the chart
  will be saved to. When it is used, the files are named using the following
  pattern: ``{entity}_{period}_{suffix}.png``. For example: ::

    bar(expr, suffix='income')

  would create "person_2002_income.png", "person_2003_income.png", etc.

* *colors*: a list of the colors to be used for the chart. See `matplotlib
  colors documentation <http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html>`_
  for the different ways you can specify colors. For example: ::

    bar(expr, colors=['r', 'g', 'b'])

  will make a bar chart with red, green and blue bars.

  .. note:: *boxplot()* does not support the *colors* argument.

* *grid* (False|True): determine whether to display a grid (in addition to
  axes ticks). It defaults to *True* for *bar()* and *plot()* and to *False*
  for *boxplot()* and *stackplot()*.

  .. note:: *pie()* does not support the *grid* argument.

* *maxticks*: limit the number of axes ticks. It defaults to 20 for all
  charts except bar3d where it defaults to 10.

  .. note:: *pie()* does not support the *maxticks* argument.

* *xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, *ymax*: provide manual bounds for charts. By
  default, they are automatically inferred from the data.

bar charts
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.8

**bar** can be used to draw bar charts. It uses `matplotlib.pyplot.bar
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar>`_  and
inherits all of its keyword arguments. There are 3 ways to use it: ::

    bar(1d_expr, ...)
    bar(1d_expr1, 1d_expr2, ...)
    bar(2d_expr, ...)

In the first two *1d_expr* is (an expression returning) a one-dimensional
array (for example an entity field or a groupby expression with only one
dimension). For example: ::

   bar(groupby(agegroup))

would produce:

.. image:: /charts/bar2.*

If one passes several arrays/expressions, they will be stacked on each
other. ::

   bar(groupby(agegroup, filter=not gender),
       groupby(agegroup, filter=gender))

.. image:: /charts/bar5.*

Alternatively, one can pass (an expression returning) a two-dimensional array,
in which case, the first dimension will be "stacked": for each possible value
of the first dimension, there will be a bar "part" with a different color. ::

    - bar(groupby(eduach, agegroup))

.. image:: /charts/bar6.*


.. index:: plot

.. versionadded:: 0.8

**plot** can be used to draw (line) plots. It uses
`matplotlib.pyplot.plot <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib
.pyplot.plot>`_ and inherits all of its keyword arguments. There are 4 ways to
use it: ::

    plot(1d_expr, ...)
    plot(1d_expr1, 1d_expr2, ...)
    plot(2d_expr, ...)
    plot(1d_expr1, style_str1, 1d_expr2, style_str2, ...)

In the first two *1d_expr* is (an expression returning) a one-dimensional
array (for example an entity field or a groupby expression with only one
dimension). For example: ::

   plot(groupby(age))

.. image:: /charts/plot03.*

If one passes several expressions, each will be plotted as a different line. ::

   plot(groupby(age),
        groupby(age, filter=not gender),
        groupby(age, filter=gender))

.. image:: /charts/plot04.*

The third option is to pass (an expression returning) a two-dimensional
array (``plot(2d_expr, ...)``) in which case, there will be one line for each
possible value of the first dimension and the second dimension will be
plotted along the x axis. For example: ::

    plot(groupby(gender, age))

.. image:: /charts/plot06.*

and, using a few of the many possible options to customize the appearance: ::

    plot(groupby(gender, agegroup),
         grid=False, linestyle='dashed', marker='o', linewidth=5)

.. image:: /charts/plot09.*

And the fourth and last option is to alternate expressions returning
one-dimensional arrays with *styles strings*
(``plot(1d_expr1, style_str1, 1d_expr2, style_str2, ...)``) which allows each
line/array to be plotted with a different style. See `plot documentation
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot>`_ for a
description of possible styles strings.

.. note:: Styles including a color (as explained in the matplotlib
          documentation -- eg 'bo') are **not** supported by our
          implementation. Colors should rather be set using the *colors*
          argument (as explained above and shown in the example below).

Example: ::

    plot(groupby(agegroup, expr=count(not gender)), 'o--',
         groupby(agegroup, expr=count(gender)), 's-.',
         groupby(agegroup), '*-'
         colors=['r', 'g', 'b'])

**stackplot** can be used to draw stacked (line) plots. It uses
`matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot>`_ and
inherits all of its keyword arguments. There are two ways to use it: ::

    stackplot(1d_expr1, 1d_expr2, ...)
    stackplot(2d_expr, ...)

Example: ::

    stackplot(groupby(eduach, age))

**pie** can be used to draw pie charts. It uses
`matplotlib.pyplot.pie
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.pie>`_ and
inherits all of its keyword arguments. It should be used like this: ::

    pie(1d_expr1, ...)

Where *1d_expr* is (an expression returning) a one-dimensional
array (for example an entity field or a groupby expression with only one
dimension). Examples: ::

  pie(groupby(eduach))
  pie(groupby(eduach),
      explode=[0.1, 0, 0],

inherits all of its keyword arguments. It should be used like this: ::

    scatter(x_expr, y_expr, ...)

Where both *x_expr* and *y_expr* are (expressions returning) one-dimensional
arrays (for example an entity field or a groupby expression with only one
dimension).

Optional keyword arguments include (among others, see above link):

* *c*: to set the color of each circle. A color will be assigned for
       each different value of this argument.
* *s*: to set the surface of each circle (mutually exclusive with the *r*
       argument).
* *r*: to set the radius of each circle (`r=expr` is equivalent to
       `s=pi * expr ** 2`). It is mutually exclusive with the *s* argument.
       The *r* argument is specific to liam2.

Examples: ::

    - salary: 10000 + uniform() * 50000
    - area: 3.1415 * (4 + 1.5 * children.count()) ** 2
    - scatter(age, salary, c=eduach, s=area, alpha=0.5s, grid=True)
    - scatter(normal(), normal(), c=age, r=2 ** eduach)

.. versionadded:: 0.8

**boxplot** can be used to draw `box plots
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot>`_. It uses
`matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot
<http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot>`_ and
inherits all of its keyword arguments. There are two ways to use it: ::

    boxplot(1d_expr1, 1d_expr2, ...)
    boxplot(2d_expr, ...)

Examples: ::

    - boxplot(age[gender], age[not gender])
    - boxplot(groupby(eduach, expr=age, filter=eduach != -1))

Debugging and the interactive console
=====================================

LIAM2 features an interactive console which allows you to interactively
explore the state of the memory either during or after a simulation completed.

You can reach it in two ways. You can either pass "-i" as the last argument
when running the executable, in which case the interactive console will launch
after the whole simulation is over. The alternative is to use breakpoints in
your simulation to interrupt the simulation at a specific point (see below).

Type "help" in the console for the list of available commands. In addition to
those commands, you can type any expression that is allowed in the simulation
file and have the result directly. Show is implicit for all operations.

*examples* ::

    >>> avg(age)
    53.7131819615

    >>> groupby(trunc(age / 20), gender, expr=count(inwork))

    trunc(age / 20) | gender |      |
                    |  False | True | total
                  0 |     14 |   18 |    32
                  1 |    317 |  496 |   813
                  2 |    318 |  258 |   576
                  3 |     40 |  102 |   142
                  4 |      0 |    0 |     0
                  5 |      0 |    0 |     0
              total |    689 |  874 |  1563

.. index:: breakpoint

breakpoint
----------

**breakpoint**: temporarily stops execution of the simulation and launch the
interactive console. There are two additional commands available in the
interactive console when you reach it through a breakpoint: "step" to execute
(only) the next process and "resume" to resume normal execution.

*general format*

    breakpoint([period])

    the "period" argument is optional and if given, will make the breakpoint
    interrupt the simulation only for that period.

*example* ::

    marriage:
        - in_couple: MARRIED or COHAB
        - breakpoint(2002)
        - ...

.. index:: assertions, assertTrue, assertEqual

assertions
----------

Assertions can be used to check that your model really produce the results it
should produce. The behavior when an assertion fails is determined by
the :ref:`assertions-label` simulation option.

- assertTrue(expr): evaluates the expression and check its result is True.
- assertFalse(expr): evaluates the expression and check its result is False.
- assertEqual(expr1, expr2): evaluates both expressions and check their
  results are equal.
- assertNanEqual(expr1, expr2): evaluates both expressions and check their
  results are equal, even in the presence of nans (because normally nan != nan).
- assertEquiv(expr1, expr2): evaluates both expressions and check their
  results are equal tolerating a difference in shape (though they must be
  compatible).
- assertIsClose(expr1, expr2): evaluates both expressions and check their
  results are almost equal.

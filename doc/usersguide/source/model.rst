Model Definition
################

To define the model, we have to describe the different
:ref:`entities_declaration`, their :ref:`fields_declaration`, the way they
interact (*links*) and how they behave over time (*processes*).

LIAM2 model files use a dialect of the YAML format. This format uses the
level of indentation and colons (**:** characters) to differenciate objects
from sub objects.

.. index:: comments

Comments
========

Another particularity inherited from YAML is the use of the hash character, `#`,
to start comments, which extend to the end of the line. A comment may
appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or a complete line of
code, but not within an expression. Since comments are only meant to clarify
code, they are ignored by LIAM2 and may be omitted if typing in examples.

General structure
=================

A LIAM2 model file has the following general structure: ::

    import:     # optional section (can be entirely omitted)
        ...

    globals:    # optional section
        ...

    entities:
        ...

    simulation:
        ...

Here is an example of what a trivial model looks like: ::

    entities:
        person:
            fields:
                # period and id are implicit
                - age: int

            processes:
                ageing:
                    - age: age + 1

    simulation:
        processes:
            - person: [ageing]
        input:
            file: input.h5
        output:
            file: output.h5
        start_period: 2015
        periods: 10


import
======

A model file can (optionally) import (an)other model file(s).
This can be used to simply split a large model file into smaller files,
or (more interestingly) to create simulation variants without having to
duplicate the common parts.

For details, see the :ref:`import_models` section.


.. index:: globals declaration
.. _globals_declaration:

globals
=======

*globals* are variables (aka. parameters) that do not relate to any particular
*entity* defined in the model. They can be used in expressions in any entity.

LIAM2 currently supports three kinds of globals: constants (scalars), tables and multi-dimensional
arrays. All kinds need to be declared in the simulation file, as follow: ::

    globals:
        BOOL_CONSTANT:
            value: True
            type: bool

        FLOAT_CONSTANT:
            value: 3.1415
            type: float

        INT_CONSTANT:
            value: 42
            type: int

        mytable:
            fields:
                - MYINTFIELD: int
                - MYFLOATFIELD: float

        MYARRAY:
            type: float

Please see the :ref:`globals_usage` usage section for how to use them in
you expressions.

Globals can be loaded from either .csv files during the simulation, or from
the HDF5 input file, along with the entities data. In the later case,
they need to be imported (as explained in the :ref:`import_data` section)
before they can be used. If globals need to be loaded from .csv files during
the simulation, the path to the files need to be given like ::

    globals:
        mytable:
            path: mytable.csv
            fields:
                - MYINTFIELD: int
                - MYFLOATFIELD: float

        MYARRAY:
            path: path\to\myarray.csv
            type: float

If no path is specified, the globals are assumed to be in the HDF5 file.

There are globals with a special status: **periodic globals**. Those globals
have a different value for each period. *periodic* is thus a reserved word
and is always a table, so the "fields" keyword can be omitted for that
table.

For example, the retirement age for women in Belgium has been gradually
increasing from 61 in 1997 to 65 in 2009. A global variable WEMRA has
therefore been included. ::

    globals:
        periodic:
            # PERIOD is an implicit column of the periodic table
            - WEMRA: float


.. index:: entities
.. _entities_declaration:

entities
========

Each entity has a unique identifier and a set of attributes (**fields**). You
can use different entities in one model. You can define the interaction between
members of the same entity (eg. between partners) or among different entities
(eg. a person and its household) using **links**.

The **processes** section describe how the entities behave. The order in which
they are declared is not important. In the **simulation** block you define if
and when they have to be executed, this allows to simulate processes of
different entities in the order you want.

In LIAM2, entities are declared as follows: ::

    entities:
        entity-name1:
            fields:     # optional section (can be omitted)
                fields definition

            links:      # optional section (can be omitted)
                links definition

            macros:     # optional section (can be omitted)
                macros definition

            processes:  # optional section (can be omitted)
                processes definition

        entity-name2:
            ...

As a reminder, indentation and the use of ":" are important.


.. index:: fields
.. _fields_declaration:

fields
------

The fields hold the information of each member in the entity. That information
is global in a run of the model. Every process defined in that entity can use
and change the value.

LIAM2 handles three types of fields:

- bool: boolean (True or False)
- int: integer
- float: real number

There are two implicit fields that do not have to be defined:

- id: the unique identifier of the item
- period: the current period in the run of the program

*example* ::

    entities:
        person:
            fields:
                # period and id are implicit
                - age:        int
                - gender:     bool
                # 1: single, 2: married, 3: cohabitant, 4: divorced, 5: widowed
                - civilstate: int
                - partner_id: int
                - earnings:   float

This example defines the entity person. Each person has an age, gender, civil
state and possibly a partner. We use the field civilstate to store the marital
status which can take one of several predefined values.

Field names must be unique per entity (i.e. several entities may have a field
with the same name).

By default, all declared fields are supposed to be present in the input file
(because they are *observed* or computed elsewhere and their value can be
found in the supplied data set) and the value for all declared fields will
be stored for each period in the output file.

However, in practice, there are often some fields which are not present in the
input file. They will need to be calculated later by the model, and you need to
tell LIAM2 that the field is missing, by using `initialdata: False` in the
definition for that field (see the *agegroup* variable in the example below).

The fields that are not present in the initial file or the fields associated
with newly created individuals of any entity can also be initialized to a
specific value by using `default: some_default_value` in the definition for
that field. If a default value is not present, fields are initialized to the
global default for the field type: False for booleans, -1 for integers and
nan for floats (see the *alive* variable in the example below).

.. _fields_output:

One can have a field not stored in the output file by using "output: False" in
its definition. Note that (local) :ref:`temporary variables within functions
<local_variables>` **do not need to be declared**. The only case where you want
to use `output: False` is when you need a variable that is accessible in several
functions but not stored in the output file.

.. warning:: All fields used in lag() expressions **must** be in the output
             file.

*example* ::

    entities:
        person:
            fields:
                - age:      int
                - agegroup: {type: int, initialdata: False}
                - temporary: {type: int, output: False}
                - alive: {type: int, initialdata: False, default: True}

links
-----

Individuals can be linked with each other or with individuals of other
entities, for example, mothers are linked to their children, partners are
linked to each other and persons belong to households.

For details, see the :ref:`links_label` section.


.. index:: macros
.. _macros_declaration:

macros
------

Macros are a way to make the code easier to read and maintain. They are defined
on the entity level. Macros are re-evaluated wherever they appear. An usual
convention is to use *capital* letters to define macros.

*example* ::

    entities:
        person:
            fields:
                - age: int

            macros:
                ISCHILD: age < 18

            processes:
                test_macros:
                    - show("before", ISCHILD)
                    - age: age + 1
                    - show("after", ISCHILD)
    simulation:
        processes:
            - person: [test_macros]


The above example does

- show(): displays whether each person is a child.
- age: the age is changed.
- show(): displays again whether each person is a child. This value is different
          than above, even though we did not explicitly assign it a new value.

processes
---------

Here you define the processes you will need in the model.

For details, see the :ref:`processes_label` section.


simulation
==========

The *simulation* block includes the location of the datasets (**input**,
**output**), the number of periods and the start period. It sets what
processes defined in the **entities** block are simulated (since some can be
omitted), and the order in which this is done.

Please note that even though in all our examples periods correspond to years,
the interpretation of the period is up to the modeller and can thus be an
integer number representing anything (a day, a month, a quarter or anything
you can think of). This is an important choice as it will impact the whole
model.

Suppose that we have a model that starts in 2002 and has to simulate for 10
periods. Furthermore, suppose that we have two entities: individuals and
households. The model starts by some initial processes (defined in the *init*
section) that precede the actual prospective simulation of the model, and that
only apply to the observed dataset in 2001 (or before). These initial
simulations can pertain to the level of the individual or the household.
Use the *init* block to calculate variables for the starting period.

The prospective part of the model starts by a number of sub-processes setting the household size and composition. Next, two
processes apply on the level of the individual, changing the age and agegroup. Finally, mortality and fertility are
simulated. Seeing that this changes the numbers of individuals in households, the process establishing the household size
and composition is again used.

*example* ::

    simulation:
        init:                   # optional
            - household: [household_composition]
            - person: [agegroup]

        processes:
            - household: [household_composition]
            - person: [
                   age, agegroup,
                   death, birth
               ]
            - household: [household_composition]

        input:
            path: liam2         # optional
            file: base.h5
        output:
            path: liam2         # optional
            file: simulation.h5
        start_period: 2015
        periods: 10
        skip_shows: False       # optional
        random_seed: 5235       # optional
        assertions: warn        # optional
        default_entity: person  # optional
        logging:                # optional
            timings: True       # optional
            level: functions    # optional
        autodump: False         # optional
        autodiff: False         # optional


processes
---------

This block defines which processes are executed and in what order. They will be
executed for each period starting from *start_period* for *periods* times.
Since processes are defined on a specific entities (they change the values of
items of that entity), you have to specify the entity before each list of
process. Note that you can execute the same process more than once during a
simulation and that you can alternate between entities in the simulation of a
period.

In the example you see that after death and birth, the household_composition
function is re-executed.

init
----

Every process specified here is only executed in the last period before
*start period* (start_period - 1). You can use it to calculate (initialise)
variables derived from observed data. This section is optional (it can be
entirely omitted).

input
-----

The initial (observed) data is read from the file specified in the *input*
entry.

Specifying the *path* is optional. If it is omitted, it defaults to the
directory where the simulation file is located.

The hdf5-file format can be browsed with *vitables*
(http://vitables.org/) or another hdf5-browser available on the net.

output
------

The simulation result is stored in the file specified in the *output* entry.
Only the variables defined at the *entity* level are stored. Temporary (local)
variables are not saved. The output file contains values for each period and
each field and each item.

Specifying the *path* is optional. If it is omitted, it defaults to the
directory where the simulation file is located.

start_period
------------

Defines the first period (integer) to be simulated. It should be consistent
(use the same scale/time unit) with the "period" column in the input data.

periods
-------

Defines the number of periods (integer) to be simulated.

random_seed
-----------

Defines the starting point (integer) of the pseudo-random generator. This
section is optional. This can be useful if you want to have several runs of a
simulation use the same random numbers.

skip_shows
----------

If set to *True*, makes all show() functions do nothing. This can speed up
simulations which include many shows (usually for debugging). Defaults to
*False*.

.. _assertions-label:

assertions
----------

This option can take any of the following values:

raise
  interrupt the simulation if an assertion fails (this is the default).

warn
  display a warning message.

skip
  do not run the assertions at all.

default_entity
--------------

If set to the name of an entity, the interactive console will start in that
entity.

logging
-------

level
~~~~~

Sets logging level. If set, it should be one of the three following values (by
increasing level of verbosity):

periods
  show only periods.

functions
  show periods and functions (this is the default).

  .. versionchanged:: 0.10
     Renamed from "procedures" to "functions".

procedures
  .. deprecated:: 0.10
     Please use "functions" instead.

processes
  show periods, functions and individual processes.

timings
~~~~~~~

If set to *False*, hide all timings from the simulation log, so that two
simulation log files are more easily comparable (for example with "diff"
tools like WinMerge). Defaults to *True*.

autodump
--------

If this option is used, at the end of each function, all (non-scalar)
variables changed during the function (including temporaries) will be dumped
in an hdf5 file (named "autodump.h5" by default). This option can be used
alone for debugging, or in combination with autodiff (in a later run).
This option can take either a filename or a boolean (in which case
"autodump.h5" is used as the filename). Defaults to *False*.

autodiff
--------

If this option is used, at the end of each function, all (non-scalar)
variables changed during the function (including temporaries) will be
compared with the values stored previously by autodump in another run of
the model (or a variant of it). This can be used to precisely compare two
versions/variants of a model and see exactly where they start to differ.
This option can take either a filename or a boolean (in which case
"autodump.h5" is used as the filename). Defaults to *False*.

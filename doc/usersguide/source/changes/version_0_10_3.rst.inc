Miscellaneous improvements
--------------------------

* updated demo models:

  - improved the dataset (which is now generated by a LIAM2 model:
    generate.yml).
  - reorganise the models to group presented features more thematically.
  - added more comments.
  - added example of progressive .csv files via mode='a'.

* added installation instructions and generally improve the out of the box
  experience on Linux. Thanks to Mahdi Ben Jelloul (:pr:`181`).

* enabled running the unit tests automatically on each change to the GitHub
  repository by using Travis-CI (which runs tests on build servers). Thanks to
  Mahdi Ben Jelloul and Christophe Benz (:pr:`182`).

* added an explicit error message when using "empty" processes (ie a "-"
  without any other text).

* moved website to its own repository (http://github.com/liam2/website).

* renamed "src" folder to "liam2" to follow standard practices. Thanks to Mahdi
  Ben Jelloul (:pr:`181`).

* improved error message of assertEqual if the array shapes are different.

* added explicit test for logit_score.
